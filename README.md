# USA Recession Predictor 
### A Simple Logistic Regression Solution built with the publicly available US Economic Data 
*Dec 2022*

## Motivation
With the economic uncertainty at the end of 2022, people are anxious about the economic outlook for 2023 and if there is a recession on the horizon. In this analysis, I am attempting to answer the following questions
1. How well we can build the recession predictor with the publicly available data?
2. What are the key factors to predict recession?
3. What is the prediction for recession in 2023 using the selected models?

## Solution Approach
#### a) Data Preparation
1. Load data & clean date field
2. Prepare quarterly datasets
3. Prepare monthly datasets
4. Create the monthly merged dataset with 6-mth adv predictor field as target varible
5. Create the quarterly merged dataset with 2-qtr adv predictor field as target varible
6. Create the monthy and quarterly datasets with "%age change" variables and remove nulls

#### b) Model Development
7. Create the clean monthly and quarterly datasets for model fitting
8. Build the Logistic regression models on monthly and quarterly datasets for recession prediction
9. Analyze the metrics for the models and answer Q1
10. Analyze the model coefficients and answer Q2

#### c) 2023 Predictions
11. Load the 2022 datasets, generate 2023 predictions and answer Q3
